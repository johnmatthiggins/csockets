# Echo Server
---
This repository contains two files:
* `main.c`: A simple web server written in C that echoes
HTTP requests that are sent to it.
* `minimal.c`: An even simpler web server that forgoes error handling to provide
    a minimal example of using Berkeley sockets to create a web server. This was written
    for [this](https://higgi.nz/blog/sockets.md) blog post.
